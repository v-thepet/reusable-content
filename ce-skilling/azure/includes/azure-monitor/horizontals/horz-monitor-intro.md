This article describes: 

- The types of monitoring data you can collect for this service.
- How to analyze that data.

>[!NOTE]
>If you're already familiar with this service and/or Azure Monitor and just want to know how to analyze monitoring data, see the [Analyze](#analyze-monitoring-data) section near the end of this article.

When you have critical applications and business processes that rely on Azure resources, you need to monitor and get alerts for your system. The Azure Monitor service collects and aggregates metrics and logs from every component of your system. Azure Monitor provides you with a view of availability, performance, and resilience, and notifies you of issues. You can use the Azure portal, PowerShell, Azure CLI, REST API, or client libraries to set up and view monitoring data.

- For more information on how to monitor Azure resources in general, see [Monitor Azure resources with Azure Monitor](/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/monitor-azure-resource). <!-- TODO can we remove this reference now? -->
