## Imported logs

The [Logs Ingestion API in Azure Monitor](/azure/azure-monitor/logs/logs-ingestion-api-overview) lets you send data to a Log Analytics workspace in Azure Monitor Logs using either a REST API call or client libraries. With the API, you can send data to supported Azure tables or to custom tables that you create. You can also extend the schema of Azure tables with custom columns to accept more data. Once imported, you can analyze the imported data using Log Analytics queries and combine it with other data in the workspace.

**TODO Add info on Event hub**
