### Sample Kusto queries

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When you select **Logs** from the service's menu in the portal, Log Analytics opens with the query scope set to the current service. This scope means that log queries will only include data from that type of resource. If you want to run a query that includes data from other Azure services, select **Logs** from the **Azure Monitor** menu. See [Log query scope and time range in Azure Monitor Log Analytics](/azure/azure-monitor/logs/scope) for details.

For a list of common queries for any service, see the [Log Analytics queries interface](/azure/azure-monitor/logs/queries).

<!-- NOTE. TODO AZMONDOCS: If we pull the queries in the Azure portal LA query interface from the backend and into the references, add a line and pointer here about that. -->
