### Advisor recommendations

If critical conditions or imminent changes occur during resource operations, an alert displays on the **Overview** page in the portal.

You can find more information and recommended fixes for the alert in **Advisor recommendations** under **Monitoring**. During normal operations, no advisor recommendations display.

For more information on Azure Advisor, see [Azure Advisor Overview](/azure/advisor/advisor-overview).
