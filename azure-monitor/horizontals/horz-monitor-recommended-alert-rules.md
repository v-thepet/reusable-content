### Recommended alert rules

For some Azure services, you can [enable recommended out-of-the-box alert rules](/azure/azure-monitor/alerts/alerts-manage-alert-rules#enable-recommended-alert-rules-in-the-azure-portal).

The system compiles a list of recommended alert rules based on:

- The resource provider's knowledge of important signals and thresholds for monitoring the resource.
- Data that tells what customers commonly alert on for this resource.

> [!NOTE]
> Recommended alert rules are available for:
> - Virtual machines
> - Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) resources
> - Log Analytics workspaces
